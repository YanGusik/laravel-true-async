 * Proxy returned to Laravel Facades for scoped services.
 *
 * Facades cache the resolved instance in a static array. In a concurrent
 * environment this cache becomes shared across coroutines, causing state
 * leaks. Instead of clearing the cache on every request (which races with
 * other coroutines), we cache this proxy once. Every facade call goes through
 * __call → resolver → current_context() → the correct per-request instance.
 *
 * DI injection (make / resolve) bypasses offsetGet and gets the real instance
 * directly, so type-hints work correctly.
