/**
 * Session handler that uses a single upsert instead of INSERT + catch + UPDATE.
 *
 * In async environments multiple coroutines can race to write the same session:
 *   - Coroutine A sends the response (client gets the cookie) and is about to
 *     call terminate() / session write.
 *   - Before A's write completes, the client fires another request (coroutine B).
 *   - B reads the session (not found yet), then both A and B try to INSERT the
 *     same session ID → duplicate key.
 *
 * The stock DatabaseSessionHandler handles this with catch(QueryException)+UPDATE,
 * but that still requires a second round-trip and can produce noisy error logs.
 *
 * This handler replaces the two-step INSERT/UPDATE with a single atomic upsert,
 * which is correct regardless of how many coroutines race to write the same ID.
